# face_mask_wear_detection
an internship projecct from i-neuron 
# TechStack/framework used
### OpenCV
### Caffe-based face detector
### Keras
### TensorFlow
### MobileNetV2
### Streamlit
# ⭐ Features
Our face mask detector doesn't use any morphed masked images dataset and the model is accurate. Owing to the use of MobileNetV2 architecture, it is computationally efficient.

This system can therefore be used in real-time applications which require face-mask detection for safety purposes due to the outbreak of Covid-19. This project can be integrated with embedded systems for application in airports, railway stations, offices, schools, and public places to ensure that public safety guidelines are followed.
